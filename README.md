# Magic-Button (WIP)

A participative art project.
Create images with a simple click of a button.
The code was generated by Claude.AI.

The key idea of this project is to simplify the act of creation—from complex techniques to a simple click—while retaining the sophisticated technology behind this simple action.

## Requirements
1. Hardware: Arduino, Jumper Wires, Tactile Switch, USB Cable
2. Software: OpenAI API (approximately 1 cent per image)

## Requirements
Hardware: Arduino, Jumper Wires, Tactile Switch, USB Cable
Software: OpenAI API (approximately 1 cent per image)

## Process
1. Connect the Arduino and switch as shown in the following diagram.
2. Plug the Arduino into your PC using a USB cable.
3. Upload the Arduino code.
4. Open the Python script.
5. Enter your OpenAI API key in the 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' section.
6. Create a folder and set its path in the 'EXPORT_LOCATION' section.
7. Enter your prompt in the 'YOUR_PROMPT_HERE' section.
8. Run the script and verify if it works. If not, restart from step 1.

## Troubleshooting Tips:
1. Check the USB cable and Arduino connection.
2. Verify the wiring between the Arduino and the switch.
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is correct.
4. Double-check the export location.

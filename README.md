# Magic-Button

A participative art project.
Create images with a simple click of a button.
The code was generated by Claude.AI.

The key idea of this project is to simplify the act of creation—from complex techniques to a simple click—while retaining the sophisticated technology behind this simple action.

## Requirements
1. Hardware: Arduino, Jumper Wires, Tactile Switch, USB Cable
2. Software: OpenAI API (approximately 1 cent per image)

## Process
1. Connect the Arduino and switch as shown in the following diagram.

3. Plug the Arduino into your PC using a USB cable.
4. Upload the Arduino code. "magic_button.ino"
5. Open the Python script. (Magic-Button)
6. Enter your OpenAI API key in the 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' section.
7. Create a folder and set its path in the 'EXPORT_LOCATION' section.
8. Enter your prompt in the 'YOUR_PROMPT_HERE' section.
9. Enter your port number in the 'YOUR_PORT_HERE' section. ex) 'COM5', 'COM6'
10. Run the script and verify if it works. If not, restart from step 1.
11. The generation of an image will take about a minute.

## Troubleshooting Tips:
1. Check the USB cable and Arduino connection.
2. Verify the wiring between the Arduino and the switch.
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is correct.
4. Double-check the export location.
5. Double-check the usb port number.
